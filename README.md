# Analysis-of-GIFTED-dataset

This is the project that I made for my Computer Applications II course at Hacettepe University. It consists of a data analysis using the R programming language. 

The dataset which is analyzed, "Gifted" consists of the IQ scores of children (variable "score") and its indicators with following variables:

fatheriq: The IQ level of the chlid's father.

motheriq: The IQ level of the child's mother.

speak: Age in months when the child spoke for the first time.

count: Age in months when the child first counted to 10 successfully.

read: Average number of hours per week the childâ€™s mother or father reads to the child.

edutv: Average number of hours per week the child watched an educational program on TV during the past three months.

cartoons: Average number of hours per week the child watched cartoons on TV during the past three months.
